(Based on Peter's idea for opening scene)

Firista: I'm approaching the target vector. How's my trajectory?

Ghost: You're doing fine, Firista.

Firista: I feel like I'm forgetting something.

Ghost: Got your blasters warmed up?

Firista: *Cocks her blaster hand-guns.* Fresh batteries and a full tank of juice.

Ghost: And your goggles. They charged?

Firista: *Raises a hand to the side of her goggles* They're at... 98%. Should I plug them in?

Ghost: *laughs* You're just nervous. Loosen up! I recommended you for this. You're ready.

Firista: *sighs* Thanks, Ghost. ... All right, I'm at the target. Initiating protocol L-327.

Firista lands her ship, attaching it to the space station with the ship's grappling claw
landing gear. She leaps out amongst a colorful starscape and lands gracefully on the hull of the
space station with the help of her energy wings. She transforms one hand into blaster mode, turns it
on like a torch, and aims it down to the surface.

Inside the station is a lab room full of computers and machinery. A guard is patrolling here when the ceiling panel above him swings open and drops onto him.

(I'm not sure how I want space to work in this universe. Is there gravity? Is there air? Does that 
matter?)

Firista flips into the room, turns and sees the guard, and instinctively aims her blasters at him.

Firista: Freeze! You're in violation of Peace Code T-099! *to Ghost, softly* Should I read him his rights?

The guard lies unconscious underneath the ceiling panel.

Firista: You have the right to remain silent.

Suddenly, a door hisses open and two guards rush in.

Firista: Ghost! We got two guards, armed! Permission to engage?

Ghost: Yes, engage! Engage!

*First battle!*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firista gets a call or message from her parents. Cole overhears.

Parents: ... I hope you're doing well at space college!

Firista: Hah, yeah! Thanks!

Later...

Cole: You don't go to space college.

Firista: They don't know that! I can't just tell them I'm a secret agent.

Cole: Are you even a secret agent anymore?

Firista: ... I don't know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Quiet character moment on geode world between Cole and Molly. Gives some of Cole's backstory and a reason why he doesn't want to go back home. Maybe feels a little explain-y, though.]

Molly: So... when do you think you'll go back?

Cole: Go back? Where?

Molly: Y'know, to your home world. Where you came from.

Cole: Back to Neopolis?

Molly: Yeah. You must miss your parents, right?

Cole: *dry laugh* Hah. Bet they don't miss me. They never did. Not when they were too busy with their jobs to spend time with me and Ash, and not when they sold me off to become this... *he looks at his hands, at a loss for words* ...freak.

Molly: Freak? That's a little harsh, don'tcha think?

Cole: What else would you call someone who can do THIS?

*He summons a fireball in his hand and points to it*

Cole: This is not normal.

*Molly shrugs*

Molly: Well, not everybody has to be.

*Cole dissolves the fireball and just shakes his head.*

Cole: Nah, I'm good where I am. Here, with Firista. She actually cares. She would never hand me over to become some science project.

*Molly shrinks at the mention of Firista's name*

Molly: Right. With Firista...

*Cole stands*

Cole: C'mon. Let's ... (go to next destination)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Side scene after getting Telebi. For fun! Shows Cole and Molly being mischievous, Firista being a little uptight, and Telebi being dumb.]

Firista: Has anyone seen my goggles?

Molly: *with a devious grin* Y'mean... THESE goggles?

*She pulls them out*

Firista: Yep, those are the ones. Thanks...

*Firista moves to take them from Molly, but Molly throws them to Cole.*

Cole: So how do these work, anyway? Do you just...

*He puts them on*

Cole: Woah! What the heck is all this stuff?

*starts moving his hands and touching the sides of the goggles*

Firista: Hey! Those are data readouts. You're gonna mess up my user settings!

Molly: *mockingly* Oh no, not the user settings!

Cole: *laughs* Hey, look! I'm Firista! *sassy, points at Molly* "Sarcasm is a violation of protocol 2 bajillion, young lady! You're going to space jail!"

*They both laugh*

Firista: I don't sound like that!

*Telebi comes in and addresses Cole*

Telebi: Hi Firista! I heard you from over there. Have you guys seen Cole?

Firista: You've gotta be kidding me...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Someone: You can't just put "space" in front of every word!

Cole: Wanna space-bet?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[At first, Borina is very sad and bored at her Space Burger job. As you buy more burgers and visit more often, she starts to warm up to you and you can unlock scenes where she interacts with the characters and has some development.]

Borina: *very bored* Welcome to Space Burger, home of the Space Burger. Can I take your order?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Borina: Hey, haven't I seen you guys before...?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Borina: You guys come here pretty often. Don't you have anything better to do?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Borina: Oh, hey. It's you guys. What can I get for you?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene with Borina (the Space Burger employee) after becoming regulars. Borina is always seen blowing bubbles with her bubble gum.]

*Cole and Molly come running up to Borina*

Cole: *urgently* Borina! Quick, what's the biggest bubble you can blow?

Borina: The biggest bubble? Eh, pretty big, I guess.

Molly: Now, how big is pretty big? This is important.

Borina: I dunno. Big.

Cole: Would you say... Bigger than your head?

Molly: Yer noggin's full of bees (You're crazy / That's crazy). There ain't no way!

Borina: *shrugs* Wanna see?

Cole and Molly: YES!

*she starts blowing a bubble. It gets as big as her head*

Cole: *turns to Molly* Hah! See? I knew she could do it!

*the bubble grows to a ridiculous size and forces Cole and Molly to back up*

Molly: Woah there, that's enough! I get it, I lost!

*bubble keeps growing!*

Cole: *delighted* This is incredible!

Molly: *terrified* She's gonna blow!

*The bubble explodes! Everything is covered in pink goo, except Borina somehow*

Borina: *chews* So, yeah. Pretty big.

Cole: *stunned and covered in gum* You're my hero...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene showing some of Molly's strange coloquialisms. Location: Subzira]

Molly: Whew! I'm hotter 'n a (something strange)

Cole: ... What?



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Molly wants to take Telebi apart]

*Cole is watching Cactus Cowboy on Telebi's face. Molly comes in*

Molly: What's this now? What's goin' on with Telebi's face?

Cole: It's the Cactus Cowboy show! Telebi's letting me watch it on him! Isn't that awesome?

Molly: *awed* Neater 'n a pastor on Sunday mornin'... How's that work, exactly?

Cole: *shrugs* I dunno.

Molly: To get this kind of signal, there's gotta be some kinda long-range radio transceiver in that noggin o' his...

*Molly looks hungrily at Telebi. Telebi is getting worried.*

Telebi: A what in my where?

Molly: Say, Telebi. You don't mind if I... take a quick look at yer innards, do ya?

Telebi: *his face goes back to normal* Huh?!

Molly: C'mon, please? Just a little bit? I promise I'll put you back together!

Telebi: I'm too young to die!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Molly wants to take Telebi apart]

*Cole is standing there, minding his own business. Telebi comes running up to him and tries to hide behind him.*

Cole: Woah, woah! What's going on?

Telebi: Shh, hold still so she can't see me!

Cole: What? Who?

Telebi: Shh!

Cole: You realize you're like 3 times my size, right?

*Molly comes in*

Molly: Telebi? Come on, it won't hurt...

Cole: What did you do to him?

Molly: Nothing! I just
