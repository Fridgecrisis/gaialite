Firista gets a call or message from her parents. Cole overhears.

Parents: ... I hope you're doing well at space college!

Firista: Hah, yeah! Thanks!

Later...

Cole: You don't go to space college.

Firista: They don't know that! I can't just tell them I'm a secret agent.

Cole: Are you even a secret agent anymore?

Firista: ... I don't know.

(Based on Peter's idea for opening scene)

Firista: I'm approaching the target vector. How's my trajectory?

Ghost: You're doing fine, Firista.

Firista: I feel like I'm forgetting something.

Ghost: Got your blasters warmed up?

Firista: *Cocks her blaster hand-guns.* Fresh batteries and a full tank of juice.

Ghost: And your goggles. They charged?

Firista: *Raises a hand to the side of her goggles* They're at... 98%. Should I plug them in?

Ghost: *laughs* You're just nervous. Loosen up! I recommended you for this. You're ready.

Firista: *sighs* Thanks, Ghost. ... All right, I'm at the target. Initiating protocol L-327.

Firista lands her ship, attaching it to the space station with the ship's grappling claw
landing gear. She leaps out amongst a colorful starscape and lands gracefully on the hull of the
space station with the help of her energy wings. She transforms one hand into blaster mode, turns it
on like a torch, and aims it down to the surface.

Inside the station is a lab room full of computers and machinery. A guard is patrolling here when the ceiling panel above him swings open and drops onto him.

(I'm not sure how I want space to work in this universe. Is there gravity? Is there air? Does that 
matter?)

Firista flips into the room, turns and sees the guard, and instinctively aims her blasters at him.

Firista: Freeze! You're in violation of Peace Code T-099! *to Ghost, softly* Should I read him his rights?

The guard lies unconscious underneath the ceiling panel.

Firista: You have the right to remain silent.

Suddenly, a door hisses open and two guards rush in.

Firista: Ghost! We got two guards, armed! Permission to engage?

Ghost: Yes, engage! Engage!

*First battle!*
